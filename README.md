Description:

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive time-series analysis and predictive modeling on the stock data of Tesla (TSLA), Ford (F), and General Motors (GM) over a four-year period (2020-2024). The goal was to analyze stock performance, daily returns, cumulative returns, and volatility, leveraging Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and financial analysis. By employing statistical methods and regression techniques, I compared the stock behaviors, identified trends, and evaluated the stability of each stock in terms of risk and returns.
Key Tasks and Achievements:

    Stock Price Analysis: Extracted and visualized historical stock data using the Stooq API to study the opening prices, volumes traded, and total value traded for Tesla, Ford, and GM.
    Trend Analysis: Computed and plotted 50-day and 200-day moving averages to identify long-term and short-term trends in stock prices for each company.
    Volatility and Risk Assessment: Analyzed daily returns and identified the most volatile stock. Created histograms and kernel density estimates (KDE) to visualize the distribution of returns, and a box plot to compare volatility across the three companies, showing that Ford stock was the most stable.
    Correlation Analysis: Developed scatter plots and regression lines to examine the correlation between Ford and GM returns, applying linear regression to assess the relationship between these two stocks.
    Cumulative Returns: Calculated cumulative returns for each stock, providing insights into the overall profit or loss over time, giving investors a clearer picture of long-term performance.
    Candlestick Chart Visualization: Created advanced visualizations such as candlestick charts for Ford using mplfinance, giving deeper insight into the stock's price movement and patterns.

Technical Skills Demonstrated:

    Data Extraction & Manipulation: Utilized pandas_datareader to fetch stock data and pandas for time-series data manipulation, including rolling averages, percentage changes, and cumulative returns.
    Data Visualization: Employed Matplotlib and mplfinance to generate various plots, such as line charts, histograms, scatter plots, candlestick charts, and regression lines to visualize stock behavior and trends.
    Statistical Analysis & Forecasting: Used statistical methods like regression analysis and volatility measurement through histograms and KDE to evaluate stock returns and their relationships.
    Technical Indicators: Computed moving averages (MA50, MA200) to identify trends in stock prices and volatility, aiding in stock trading strategies.
    Risk Assessment: Analyzed volatility using daily returns and created a comparative analysis of stock risks, providing insights into the stability of Ford, GM, and Tesla stocks.

This project demonstrated advanced analytical and technical capabilities in time-series forecasting, stock analysis, and financial data visualization, showcasing proficiency in Python for financial modeling and data-driven decision-making
